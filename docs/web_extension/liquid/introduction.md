# Introduction

The liquid wallet api allows web applications to be built that interact with user wallets. The first implementation of the API is [Liquality Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/liquality-wallet/kpfopkelmapcoipemfendmdcghnegimn?hl=en) and [Marina](https://vulpem.com/marina) 

As a Liquid user, you can carry your wallet across applications as a form of identity and as a means to have a more usable experience using your Liquid Bitcoin and other assets.
