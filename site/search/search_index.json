The most important parameters to update include your mongo db, as well as the bitcoin and ethereum node url's, credentials together with contract addresses for supported assets you wish to host. Initiate our market data. $ npm run migrate This will create a database in mongo db which includes the necessary list of supported assets, rates and other meta data which is configurable by the agent operator.

The API service provides an http interface for create quotes and managing order information in mongo. Support for this API has been integrated into the UI, but can be used for integration by any other application. $ npm run api We can confirm that the api is up and running by issuing a GET query against the marketinfo endpoint. $ curl -s http://localhost:3030/api/swap/marketinfo | jq .

To avoid adding overhead to the APIs, we have isolated all the administrative overhead and back-office processing into a service worker architecture. This provides a separation of concerns which allows for more streamlined operation as well as debugging and future scaling. $ npm run worker You should now have a operation version of the agent running on your local system. You can now enable integration between the user interface and agent by uncommenting the hostAgent configuration parameter we had added during the previous steps. $ vi ./src/config/config.js ... hostAgent: 'http://localhost:3030' , ... Once enabled, your local user interface should present you with a list of available assets for swapping.

An instance of the UI and agent configured for the bitcoin and ethereum testnets has been setup here for convenience. The components covered will include the liquality swap user interface , and an optional automated agent . The swap interface is a functional reference implementation that facilitates the workflow between two anonymous parties wishing to swap digital assets with minimized counter party risk. The automated agent can be thought of a as a back-office system for those wishing to enable an automated market making system which is complimentary, but independent from the user interface.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"server/administration/prerequisites/","text":"Prerequisites \u00b6 Before we can invoke an operational instance of the agent and user interface, it is recommended that you install the following prerequisites. This is not a requirement, but suggested to avoid having to delegate trust to any third party. In this tutorial we will guide you through setting up a working stance of the liquality user interface and agent against a local testing configuration . You can however also follow these same steps against testnet or mainnet nodes depending on your requirement and once you feel more comfortable with the setup. Components which fall out of the scope for the liquality stack and which are required include: Required for the User Interface and Agent \u00b6 Bitcoin Node Ethereum Node - We will be using ganache considering this is for testing purposes. NodeJS Required for the Agent \u00b6 MongoDB >= 4.x - Required for the agent Optional depending on your preferences \u00b6 Esplora Block Explorer APIs - optional if you do not wish to use the blockstream hosted instance. CORS Proxy - Required to enable CORS for your bitcoin node. You can also use nginx or any other reverse proxy which enables CORS separately. JQ - Optional json command line parser, only used for legibility. For convenience, we've also added a docker-compose script which will setup a local bitcoin and ethereum environment which you can use for testing. $ git clone --branch master https://github.com/liquality/liquality-swap/ $ cd ./liquality-swap/src/test/integration/environment/ $ docker-compose up The above will start a bitcoin node in regtest mode with a cors proxy exposed over port 18443, as well as a ethereum ganache instance over port 8545. You will have to install mongo separately. You can test this as follows.
